https://bridge.holi0317.net/

## Overview
Bridge calc helps you to calculate score for a German Bridge game. It can be used offline (if browser supports) and automatically store data for next use.

This is built on top of Polymer and follows most best practices. Therefore it has great speed.

## Note for old browser user
If a warning is shown on screen, update your browser soon. As soon as uglifyJS officially supports ES6, this will be rewritten and most likely fail on your browser.

And yes, my policy towards old browser is to screw them.
