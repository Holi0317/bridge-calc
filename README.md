# Deployed Bridge calc v1.0.0 archive

This is a special branch for archive deployed v1.0.0 of Bridge calculator

Due to changes to `polymer-cli`, building from old source just gives error.

Some files are missing from this version. But this can still be run.

Only Chromium browser is supported because web components polyfill is not included.

In the future, this branch will not work as chromium will drop support on v0 custom element soon.

To run this, execute `python3 -m http.server` on this directory, assume python3 is installed.
